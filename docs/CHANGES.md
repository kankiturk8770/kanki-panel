# v2.1.0

## New
- **Dashboard** is now the home page: live CPU / RAM / storage / swap gauges, network speed chart, TCP / UDP connections, user counters and service cards with start / stop / restart. Refresh 1 / 2 / 5 / 10 s, pause button.
- `GET /api/live` (admin): cumulative CPU jiffies, memory, swap, default-route interface counters, TCP established / listening and UDP socket counts. The browser turns two samples into percentages and speeds, so the server keeps no state.
- `POST /api/services/:name/:action` with `start`, `stop`, `restart`. `web`, `panel` and `node` can only be restarted (stopping them would cut off the panel itself).
- **Users page rebuilt**: cards with toggle switch, protocol tags, Jalali dates, usage bar and 5 quick buttons; search, status / protocol filters, sorting, select all + bulk bar, pagination with page size; edit sheet with Jalali date input and quick add of days / GB.
- **Subscription page rebuilt**: data / time rings, status pill, subscription + raw links, per-node protocol cards, app / support buttons. All server-rendered hooks (`data-act`, `data-i18n`, `{{placeholders}}`) are unchanged, so the Kanki app keeps working.
- Dates are shown in the Jalali calendar with Persian digits when the language is Persian.

## Changed
- The old **System** page is gone, the Dashboard replaces it.
- `POST /api/services/:name/restart` became `POST /api/services/:name/:action`.
- After login the panel opens on the Dashboard instead of Users.
- Modals open as bottom sheets on phones; Esc closes them.

# v2.0.0

## Bugs fixed
- Traffic could be counted twice when two sync rounds overlapped (timer + user edit). Sync is now serialized.
- Connection limit was only displayed. Now enforced for OpenVPN + Hysteria2 at login time, across all nodes.
- Panel <-> node traffic (node token and every user key) went over plain HTTP with certificate checks disabled. New nodes sit behind Caddy TLS; certificates are verified unless a node is explicitly marked self-signed. Old HTTP nodes still work and show a warning.
- Admin password used a single SHA-256. Now PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (120k rounds); old hashes upgrade on next login.
- Login had no rate limit and sessions never expired / lived only in memory. Now IP lockout after 6 failures, DB-backed sessions with configurable lifetime.
- Expired / disabled users stayed connected on Hysteria2 until they dropped. They are now kicked on the next sync (OpenVPN too).
- WG/AWG peers were pushed to nodes where that protocol isn't installed, so nodes looked out of sync. Fixed, plus a real sync-state indicator.
- Constant-time comparison for tokens and passwords.
- Usernames are validated (they end up in file names and OpenVPN).
- Regenerating a user's link now also rotates their WG/AWG keys.

## New
OpenVPN UDP/TCP, security center, encrypted backups + Telegram schedule, node drain/maintenance/health/repair/update, self-update, English installer with `kanki` menu, FA/EN + light/dark + color themes, redesigned subscription page.
